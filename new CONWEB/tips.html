    <p><strong>Setting Tickets as Pending Customer</strong></p>
    <p>Email tickets should only be set to Pending_Customer if you need more information to solve the problem (ex. Course name for a BB issue, NetID, MAC address/location for an ethernet issue). If the solution you provide has worked in the past more than 90% of the time, the ticket can be marked as Completed. On the off-chance that your solution may not work, you can append the following message:</p>
    <p>"We are closing your ticket as 'resolved successfully' because these troubleshooting methods almost always resolve issues similar to yours. If these methods fail, please respond to this email, which will reopen your ticket and alert us that further troubleshooting steps are necessary. Please include any error messages or symptoms which occur, if any. You can also call us at (847) 491-4357 [1-HELP]."</p>
    <p>If you’re ever unsure of whether a ticket should be set as Pending_Customer or not, ask the supervisor.</p>

    <p><strong>Reassigning Referrals</strong></p>
    <p>To reassign email tickets to internal support groups, change the ticket to “In Progress”, categorize the ticket appropriately (or to the best of your ability), and change the assignment group (by removing AAA_IT_SupportCenter and adding the correct team). Do not write a description to the end user!</p>
    <p>Note that you will still need to include the 2-point referral for phone tickets!</p>

    <p><strong>Smart Classrooms (LSTS) Ticket Template</strong></p>
    <p>Follow the template as set forth in the Smart Classrooms template! It automatically sets the ticket as Open, includes detailed filler text built towards their expectations, and provides the specialists with as much information as we are capable of obtaining/giving. Remember to use the dropdown menus to provide the room/building location.</p>

    <p><strong>Jacks</strong></p>
    <p>It is easy to tell which jacks are for phones or for Ethernet based on the nomenclature of the jack, and the jack location. In offices, classrooms, etc., NNN-X (where N is room number, and X is jack) refers to Ethernet; CDCnnnnn and EDCnnnnn (Chicago vs. Evanston data circuit) refer to circuitry, and phones have 491, 467, 503, 134, and 908 preceding their numbers.</p>

    <p><strong>Jacks 2</strong></p>
    <p>It is easy to tell which jacks are for phones or for Ethernet based on the nomenclature of the jack, and the jack location. In dorms, the naming system for circuits is ESDnnnn (Evanston student data), and the phone lines start with 332 (which is legacy from when all dorms had landlines).</p>
