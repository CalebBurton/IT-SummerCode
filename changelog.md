## [0.0.1] - 2017-08-30
### Added
- This changelog file. It's probably not super necessary for this type of project, but it's a good habit that I want to develop now
- All the files I've been developing over the past three months. It probably would have been good to do this at the beginning of the summer instead of the end, but here we are.
