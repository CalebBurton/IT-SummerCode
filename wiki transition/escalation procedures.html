    <h3>On-Call Engineer Procedures: TSC</h3>
    <div>
        In the event of a service outage or other urgent issue that requires immediate attention from PIPS, TNS or ISSC, Northwestern IT staff have been instructed to call 1-HELP to get expedited assistance in reaching their on-call engineer. We should follow this procedure: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Users will reach us by calling 1-HELP, option 7. <strong>This routes directly to Tier 2</strong> with the toast alert "Escalated tech support Evanston IL".
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>If user does not choose option 7 and call routes to TSC</strong>, Tier 1 should follow the steps below. Note that outside Tier 2 business hours, option 7 routes calls directly to the SOC.
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Make sure the user provides the following information:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Their name and NetID</li>
                            <li>Which IT department they're in</li>
                            <li>Their call-back number</li>
                            <li>Which on-call engineer role they need; if they ask for a specific engineer by name, ask what team that engineer is on</li>
                            <li>A brief description of the urgent issue or outage</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Verify all user information, especially contact information</li>
                    <li>Escalate the interaction as an incident to the SO-SOC assignment group.</li>
                    <li>Call the SOC at 7-2222 and ask them to page the requested engineer. If the user didn't know which engineer role they need, ask the SOC to page the PIPS-Infrastructure engineer. Give the SOC the incident number, user's name and call-back number.</li>
